# IzyCode_House_Price_Prediction_using_Linear_Regression

This repository explores predicting house prices using a linear regression model based on three key features: square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms.

**Project Goal**:- The goal is to develop a model that can estimate the selling price of a house based on these readily available features. This can be a valuable tool for homeowners, real estate agents, and anyone interested in the housing market.

**Dataset :-** The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is not included due to potential licensing restrictions. However, you can access a sample dataset by clicking the following link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XgDjLFuD7LPR3CBohuyx4lUJWqQgZu0W

Please note: Depending on the dataset source, you may need to download and pre-process the data before using it with this code.

**Methodology** 
This project follows a structured approach to building the linear regression model:

**Data Preparation:**
  * Clean and pre-process the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
  * Analyze feature distributions and relationships.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

  * Visualize the distribution of house prices and other features.
  * Identify potential correlations between features.

**Data Splitting:**
  * Divide the data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

**Model Training:**
  * Train the linear regression model using the training data.
  * Optimize model parameters for best performance.

**Model Evaluation:**
  * Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like mean squared error (MSE).
  * Analyze the model's coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on house price predictions.

**Visualization:**
  * Visualize the model's predictions against the actual house prices to assess model fit.

**Technologies and Tools**
This project primarily relies on:

* Python - Programming Language
* Pandas - Data Analysis Library
* Scikit-learn - Machine Learning Library (for linear regression)
* Matplotlib / Seaborn - Data Visualization Libraries
  
**Contribution**

  * A special thanks to the IzyCode mentors and contributors who have made this project possible.
  * Gratitude to the open-source community for providing the tools and libraries used in this project.
